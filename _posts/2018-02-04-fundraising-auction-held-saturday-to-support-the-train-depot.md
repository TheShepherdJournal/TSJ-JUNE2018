Community members gathered inside the Shepherd Bar &amp; Restaurant Saturday afternoon to participate in a charity auction held to raise money for Shepherd's Train Depot. A number of items, donated by local businesses, were on display inside the restaurant prior to the start at auction. Steve Davidson served as the auctioneer, describing each item and then taking bids.

On the morning before the event, Gina Gross <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gina.steeregross/videos/1627527610668482/">posted the following on Facebook</a>:
<blockquote>Today 3 to 6 at Shepherd Bar...Shepherd Depot Auction! So many generous people that have donated so many items for this event. We cannot thank you enough!! Look it over and see what you want to bid on...so much fun! Hope to see you this afternoon!!!</blockquote>
