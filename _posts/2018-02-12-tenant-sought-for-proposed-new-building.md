<blockquote>Commercial tenant wanted - We have a purchase agreement on these lots in the downtown business district in the village of Shepherd. We have designed a building to included 2 separate commercial spaces; one for us on the west (right) side and one for a commercial tenant on the east (left) side. This could be built to suite, 1,000 to 1,200 square ft., for one or two business sharing that space. Monthly rent would be $950 with utilities paid by the tenant. Expected completion late summer or early fall of 2018. I can only move forward with the building if I have a tenant. Please share this post.</blockquote>
Based on the photos posted, this building would fill the lot next to the new Eight 2 Eight rental hall.
