From Jay Gross:

I can’t make this stuff up...

Adriana Nelson stopped in to see me again Friday...

I had something for her...<!--more-->

See, Shepherd Alum Kyle Edward Hiner has moved to Lansing... he got a hold of me and drove up here last week with a gift... a gift for Adri.

Kyle had gone around his Marine platoon and explained Adri’s fight to his fellow warriors... and with him he carried the Marine flag... which each one of them signed and sent words of encouragement for her...

And one did something even more...

In a glass jar Adri was given sand... not any old sand but sand from Iwo Jima... directly from the beach where our troops stormed...

For her to open and touch when she needs to draw strength, strength from Marines here now and from the past...

All this for a young warrior who these Marines and Kyle have never met... just heard about...

There is so much strength in kindness...
