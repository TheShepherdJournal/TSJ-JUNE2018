A service will be held at the Westlawn Church of Christ in Shepherd, Michigan on Saturday, March 10th at 11 a.m. Visitation will be held at the Berry Funeral Home on Friday evening from 2 - 8 p.m., and at the Westlawn Church on Saturday at 10 a.m. before the service. Burial will in Salt River Cemetery with a meal following at the Westlawn Church of Christ.<!--more-->
