On March 22, students in the Third, Fourth, and Fifth grade at Winn Elementary learned about cyber safety, bullying, choices and consequences from Trooper White and Chief Sawyer. Trooper White will also be retiring on May 1st.

“Winn Elementary School wishes him the best on his retirement,” a post on the Winn Elementary School Facebook page said. “A huge thank you to both officers for a great presentation.”
